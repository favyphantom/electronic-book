LaTeX-style maths via MathJax can be inline ((E = mc^2)) or displayed: [P_{t+1} - P_t=frac{b+d}{s}(P_t-overline{P})] The maths above and below is borrowed and adapted from The Economy by CORE. [P_{t+2} - P_{t+1}=frac{b+d}{s}(P_{t+1}-overline{P})] It follows from (P_{t} = overset{overline{}}{P} - frac{s}{b + d}E_{t}) , (E_{t} = P_{t + 1} - P_{t}) and the equation above that [begin{align} frac{P_{t+2} - P_{t+1}}{P_{t+1} - P_{t}} &=  frac{P_{t+1}-overline{P}}{ P_{t}-overline{P}} &= R end{align}]"}
